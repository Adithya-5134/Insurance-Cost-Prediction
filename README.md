# 🌟 Insurance Cost Prediction 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict medical expenses for risk assessment, premium determination, and profitability. It analyzes factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, gender, dependents, and region. The goal is to uncover patterns, prepare data, and evaluate ML models to enhance risk assessment and customer benefits while minimizing financial risks.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **📄 File:** Insurance.csv
- **📊 Features:**
  - 🏆 age: Age of the insured individual
  - 👫 sex: Gender of the insured individual
  - ⚖️ bmi: Body Mass Index
  - 👶 children: Number of children covered by insurance
  - 🚬 smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)
  - 🌍 region: Residential region of the insured individual
  - 💰 charges: Insurance charges (Target Variable)

## 🔍 Model Implementation
- **📜 File:** INSURANCE_COST_PREDICTION_final.ipynb
- **🛠️ Steps Followed:**
  1. 🏗️ **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, encoding categorical data
  2. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Identifying correlations and distributions
  3. 🤖 **Model Selection** - Training different regression models
  4. 📈 **Model Evaluation** - Comparing accuracy and performance metrics

## 🤖 Models Used
- 🔹 **Linear Regression**
- 🔹 **Decision Tree Regressor**
- 🔹 **Random Forest Regressor**
- 🔹 **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- 🔹 **XGBoost Regressor**
- 🔹 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor**


## 📉 Metrics Used
- 📌 **R² Score**
- 📌 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- 📌 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- 📌 **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

## 🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization
- Used **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for fine-tuning model hyperparameters.
- Applied **cross-validation** techniques to improve model generalization.

## 🔑 Key Insights
- 🚬 **Smoking** has a significant impact on insurance costs, with smokers being charged much higher.
- 📈 **BMI and Age** also strongly influence the predicted cost.
- 🌍 **Region** has minimal effect on insurance costs compared to other factors.

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project successfully predicts insurance charges using multiple regression models. The **Random Forest Regressor** performed the best among the models tested. The findings highlight that smoking, BMI, and age are crucial factors in determining insurance costs.
